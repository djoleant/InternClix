## **About**
InternClix is platform made for students who are looking forward to finding and applying to an internship. It is also made for employers to post internships their company is offering. Student can see basic employer's info, ratings of employer, common interview questions and can apply to their internship. Employer can see which student is the best match for their internship based on student's skills and abilities. After employer accepts or denies student, platform automatically initiates chat between student and employer, so they can discuss about the application outcome.
